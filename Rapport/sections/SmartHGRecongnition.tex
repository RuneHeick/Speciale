\chapter{SmartHG Data Recognition} 
The \ab{ECO} dataset, consists of 6 houses and the data is sampled at one hertz over a period  of 8 months. The SmartHG dataset is different in many aspects. The data is sampled at $\frac{1}{30}$ hertz on 25 houses over a period of 6 month. Each house have only a small number of sub-meters. The sub-meters is mainly placed on little consumers, which presents a interesting challenge for load disaggregation.
