## NILM-Eval

NILM-Eval: An evaluation framework for non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms

## Project overview

NILM-Eval is a MATLAB framework that allows to evaluate non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms in different scenarios to gain a comprehensive view on their performance.
NILM-Eval makes it easy to evaluate algorithms on multiple data sets, households, data granularities, time periods, and specific algorithm parameters.
By encapsulating those parameters in configurations, NILM-Eval further allows the user with little effort to repeat experiments performed by others, to evaluate an algorithm on a new data set, and to fine-tune configurations to improve the performance of an algorithm in a new setting.

* [The ECO dataset](http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=eco-data): Together with *Energie Thun*, a Swiss energy provider, we collected the ECO data set (Electricity Consumption and Occupancy). Using NILM-Eval, we evaluated the performance of four NILM algorithms on the ECO data set.

## Project team

NILM-Eval is a research activity of the [Distributed Systems Group](http://vs.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. It was initiated in the context of the project [Smart Meter Services](http://vs.inf.ethz.ch/res/show.html?what=smart-meter-services), in which we develop methods to analyze smart meter consumption data to offer novel services to households.
