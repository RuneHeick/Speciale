QUICK Guide:
============

This is a quick guide how to run an algorithm (i.e., Weiss) on a data set (i.e., the ECO data set):

1) Download the data (Matlab files) and copy it to "data/eco/plugs/" and "data/eco/smartmeter", respectively. The subfolders of "smartmeter" and "plugs" should be named "01", "02", ..., which represents the individual households.
2) Perform the experiment on 90 day consumption data: Set "config_file = 'input/evaluation_days/first_90.yaml';" in "save_evaluation_days.m" and run the script.
3) Run Weiss' algorithm on household 2, using different parameter values for the scaling parameter 'r'. This is an existing experiment, which can be configured as follows:

Add the following two lines to "create_experiment.m" and "run_experiment.m":

    configuration_input = 'input/configurations/weiss_initial.yaml';
    experiment_input = 'input/experiments/weiss/2014-07-01-all-households.yaml';

Now run these two scripts subsequently.

4) Done, the results are stored in "results/summary/weiss/..." and "results/details/weiss/..."
